🌳 Machine Learning Pipeline with Decision Trees 🌳
Welcome to the Machine Learning Pipeline project! This repository showcases a pipeline using Decision Trees for predicting outcomes, complete with data preprocessing, model training, and error handling. 🎯

📊 Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline that includes:

🔄 Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and converting string attributes to numerical formats.
🌲 Model Training: Utilizing the Decision Tree Regressor for prediction tasks.
🛠️ Error Handling: Addressing common issues such as string-to-float conversion errors in Pandas DataFrames.
🚀 Features
Scalable Pipeline: Easily adaptable to different datasets and machine learning models.
Robust Error Handling: Ensures smooth execution by addressing common data processing errors.
Comprehensive Documentation: Clear and concise documentation of each step in the pipeline.
